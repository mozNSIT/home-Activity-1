Mars (Latin: Mars, adjectives Martius and Martialis) was the Roman god of war and 
also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome.
 He was second in importance only to the chief god Jupiter, and he was the most 
prominent of the military gods worshipped by the Roman legions. 
His festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, 
which began and ended the season for military campaigning and farming.
Mars (Mars symbol.svg) is the ruling planet of Aries and, in traditional western astrology, 
Scorpio, and is exalted in Capricorn. Mars is the Roman god of war and bloodshed, 
whose symbol is a spear and shield. Both the soil of Mars and the hemoglobin of human
blood are rich in iron, and because of this they share its distinct deep red color.
Mars orbits the Sun in 687 days, spending about 57.25 days in each sign of the zodiac. 
It is also the first planet that orbits outside of Earth's orbit, making it the first planet that 
does not set along with the Sun.</font><font face="Harlow Solid Italic" size=6 color=orange><br>
