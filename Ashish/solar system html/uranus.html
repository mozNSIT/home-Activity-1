<font face="Harlow Solid Italic" color=#6600CC size=6>Uranus is the seventh 
planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and 
fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. It is named after the ancient 
Greek deity of the sky Uranus the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of 
Zeus (Jupiter). Though it is visible to the naked eye like the five classical 
planets, it was never recognized as a planet by ancient observers because of its 
dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on March 
13, 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time 
in modern history. Uranus was also the first planet discovered with a 
telescope.Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both are of different 
chemical composition than the larger gas giants Jupiter and </font>

up the lowest clouds, and methane thought to make up the uppermost layer of 
clouds. In contrast the interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and 
rock.Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, 
and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among the 
planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane 
of its revolution about the Sun. As such, its north and south poles lie where 
most other planets have their equators. Seen from Earth, Uranus's rings can 
sometimes appear to circle the planet like an archery target and its moons 
revolve around it like the hands of a clock, though in 2007 and 2008 the rings 
appeared edge-on. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as a virtually 
featureless planet in visible light without the cloud bands or storms associated 
with the other giants. However, terrestrial observers have seen signs of 
seasonal change and increased weather activity in recent years as Uranus 
approached its equinox. The wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 meters per 
second (900 km/h, 560 mph)</font><font face="Harlow Solid Italic" color=#6600CC size=10>.</font><font face="Harlow Solid Italic" color=#00FFFF size=10><br>
