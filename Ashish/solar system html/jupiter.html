Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet within the Solar System.
 It is a gas giant with a mass slightly less than one-thousandth of the Sun but is two and a
 half times the mass of all the other planets in our Solar System combined. Jupiter is classified as
 a gas giant along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Together, these four planets are sometimes
 referred to as the Jovian planets.The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times 
and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures. 
The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, 
Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of -2.94, making it on average the third-brightest 
object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. (Mars can briefly match Jupiter's brightness 
at certain points in its orbit.)Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its 
mass being helium; it may also have a rocky core of heavier elements. Because of its rapid 
rotation, Jupiter's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge 
around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different 
latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. 
A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since 
at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding the planet is a faint 
planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. 
There are also at least 63 moons, including the four large moons called the Galilean moons 
that were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these moons, 
has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.Jupiter has been explored on several 
occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby 
missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the 
Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007. The probe used the gravity 
from Jupiter to increase its speed. Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include 
the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa.<br>&nbsp;</font><p>
