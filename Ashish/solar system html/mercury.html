because it seemed to move more quickly than other known planets. in 2004 NASA launched MESSENGER
probe, which is due to raech Mercury in 2011.At this time, little is known about this comparatively small planet. The only spacecraft to come close to Mercury was Mariner 10 from 1974 to 1975, which was only able to map 40%–45% of the planet's surface. 
From the photographs and other information that has been collected, it has been 
determined that the surface of Mercury is very similar to our own moon, heavily cratered
and barren. The magnetic force generated by Mercury’s iron core is only about 1% as
 strong as that of Earth’s. Temperatures on Mercury can range anywhere from 90 to 700 degrees K!</font><font size=10><font face=jokerman size=6 color=#00FFFF><br>
