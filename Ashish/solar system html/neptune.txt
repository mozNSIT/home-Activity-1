Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. 
Named for the Roman god of the sea, it is the fourth-largest planet by 
diameter and the third largest by mass. Neptune is 17 times the mass of 
Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 
times the mass of Earth but not as dense.[12] On average, Neptune orbits 
the Sun at a distance of 30.1 AU, approximately 30 times the Earth–Sun 
distance. Its astronomical symbol is  a stylized version of the god 
Neptune's trident.
Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical prediction rather than 
by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led 
Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational 
perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed on 
September 23, 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position 
predicted by Urbain Le Verrier, and its largest moon, Triton, was discovered 
shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 12 moons were 
located telescopically until the 20th century. Neptune has been visited
by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet on 
August 25, 1989.
Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both have compositions 
which differ from those of the larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. 
Neptune's atmosphere, while similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in that 
it is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of 
hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, contains a higher proportion of "ices" 
such as water, ammonia and methane. Astronomers sometimes categorize Uranus
 and Neptune as "ice giants" in order to emphasize these distinctions. 
The interior of Neptune, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of 
ices and rock. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part 
account for the planet's blue appearance.
